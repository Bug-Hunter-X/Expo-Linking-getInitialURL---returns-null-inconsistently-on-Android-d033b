This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  The `getInitialURL` async function sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is successfully opened, leading to unexpected behavior in the app. This inconsistency appears to be related to the timing of when `getInitialURL` is called in the app's lifecycle, particularly when the app is launched from a cold start and has not fully initialized.
